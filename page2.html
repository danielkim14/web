   <p>
   The Flash has a tv show on the CW which first aired back in 2014(you can see more about that here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(The_Flash)">The Flash Wiki</a>) and has continued for 6 seasons. The first season starts out with Barry gaining his powers. It introduces Barry's backstory and introduces most of the side characters as well. Throughout the six seasons, Barry fights several villains. These include, the Reverse Flash, Zoom, Savitar, The Thinker, Cicada and Bloodwork/Mirror Master. He also does several crossovers with other shows such as The Arrow and Supergirl. In each season, Barry has to go faster, surpass his limits and gain new abilities in order to defeat each villain.
