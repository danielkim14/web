  <h2>What is the TV show about</h2>
   <p>
  The Flash has a TV show on the CW which first aired back in 2014(you can see more about that here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(The_Flash)">The Flash Wiki</a>) and has continued for 6 seasons. The show portrays the early life of The Flash before he joins The Justice League. The show starts out with Barry working in his lab. The particle accelerator, made by Harrison Wells, explodes. This explosion creates a storm that strikes Barry with a lightning bolt giving him superhuman abilities. However, this causes other humans to gain superhuman abilities as well. Barry has to defeat these metahumans before they can use their abilities to harm innocent people. Throughout the six seasons, Barry fights several villains. These include the Reverse-Flash, Zoom, Savitar, The Thinker, Cicada, and Bloodwork/Mirror Master. He also does several crossovers with other shows such as The Arrow and Supergirl. In each season, Barry has to go faster, surpass his limits and gain new abilities in order to defeat each villain.
