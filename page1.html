   <h2 id="intro">Who is the Flash</h2>
   <p>
   The Flash is a superhero with super-speed who wears a red and yellow suit and saves the people of Central City and eventually the world. Here is a picture <a href=https://images.app.goo.gl/uT2Jm5xP6S2fEJ4J9>The Flash</a>. The Flash, whose real name is Barry Allen, gained his speed by being struck by lightning, the same day that a particle accelerator exploded. He meets the scientists of Star Labs who train him and help him become the hero that he is today. Now he races around the city saving people from villains that terrorize the city. He also joins the Justice League and teams up with other heroes such as Superman and Green Lantern.
