   <h2>Why I liked it</h2>
   <p>
   I really enjoyed watching all six seasons of the Flash. Each season was packed with action and awesome fight scenes. Each of the characters felt unique with their own backstories and history. The show does well to make each character feel just as important the main character. For example, Caitlen Snow, later known as Killer Frost, is a side character who helps Th Fash protect the city. Caitlen developed her powers as a child and later, with the help of her friends, learns how to use her power for good. One of my favorite episodes is <a href= "https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Yellow_Suit">Reverse Flash</a>.
