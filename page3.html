   <h2>Why I liked it</h2>
   <p>
   I really enjoyed watching all six seasons of the Flash. Each season was packed with action and awesome fight scenes. The story progressed well and I enjoyed binging all of the episodes. Each of the characters felt unique with their own backstories and personality. The show does well to make each character feel just as important as the main character. For example, Caitlin Snow, later known as Killer Frost, is a side character who helps The Flash protect the city. Killer Frost has the ability to manifest freezing temperatures and structures of ice. Caitlin developed her powers as a child and later, with the help of Barry and the rest of the team at Star Labs, learns how to use her power for good. One of my favorite episodes is <a href= "https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Yellow_Suit">Reverse Flash</a>. In this episode, Barry has his first confrontation with the man who killed his mother when he was a child.
