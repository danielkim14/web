<h1>Plagiarism Detector</h1>
<h2>Daniel Kim Period 9</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Project Description</b></li>
			This is a program that detects plagarism in two different pieces of text.  
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Instructions</b></li>
			Open the python program and enter one file from your computer where it says "text1" and another file you want to compare it with in "text2". Click Enter and then the results will appear. It will tell you how similar the two pieces of texts are. 
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><b>How it works</b></li>
			Our code involves the usage of the difflib module from SequenceMatcher. This module helps with comparing sequences and files, which will be a foundation for our program. First, the user will upload two text in the dictionary (we provided a sample text for practice) and then the files will be read. When the files are read the similarities and differences are computed. Sequencematcher matches the two sequences from text1 and text2. Lastly, the results are produced as a statement telling you how similar the two texts are.

			<li>final.html: This html file</li>			
			<li>pythonproject.py: Main part of the project (where you upload your files and where the files are read to be computed).</li>
			<li>sitestyle.css: For styling webpage</li>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Bugs, Errors, and Things to be Aware of</b></li> 
			<ul>
			<li>The program doesn't take note of the context the words are in, just how many times a word appears in both texts.</li>
