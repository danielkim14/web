   <h2 id="intro">Who is the Flash</h2>
   <p>
   The Flash is a superhero with super speed who wears a red suit and saves the people of Central City and eventually the world. Here is a picture <a href=https://images.app.goo.gl/uT2Jm5xP6S2fEJ4J9>The Flash</a>. The Flash, who's real name is Barry Allen, gained his speed by being struck by lightning, the day a particle accelerator exploded. Now he races aound the city saving people form villains and teams up with other heros such as Superman and Green Lantern.

   <h2>What is the TV show about</h2>
   <p>
   The Flash has a tv show on the CW which first aired back in 2014(you can see more about that here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(The_Flash)">The Flash Wiki</a>) and has continued for 6 seasons. The first season starts out with Barry gaining his powers. It introduces Barry's backstory and introduces most of the side characters as well. Throughout the six seasons, Barry fights several villains. These include, the Reverse Flash, Zoom, Savitar, The Thinker, Cicada and Bloodwork/Mirror Master. He also does several crossovers with other shows such as The Arrow and Supergirl. In each season, Barry has to go faster, surpass his limits and gain new abilities in order to defeat each villain.

   <h2>Why I liked it</h2>
   <p>
   I really enjoyed watching all six seasons of the Flash. Each season was packed with action and awesome fight scenes. Each of the characters felt unique with their own backstories and history. The show does well to make each character feel just as important the main character. For example, Caitlen Snow, later known as Killer Frost, is a side character who helps Th Fash protect the city. Caitlen developed her powers as a child and later, with the help of her friends, learns how to use her power for good. One of my favorite episodes is <a href= "https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Yellow_Suit">Reverse Flash</a>.
